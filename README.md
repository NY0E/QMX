# QMX
Notes on the QMX

Buying the QMX from QRP-labs.com is just the first step. It does NOT ship with everything needed to get up and running.

In addition to the radio, the following are also required:
<br>12v power source | I googled "QMX Power source" and found a discussion on QRP-Labs forums with specific amazon listings. It's possible to power the QMX off of power bricks you have laying around already, but you need to make sure no more than 12v are being sent to the QMX. A "Trigger cable" is a good option. The first one I bought didn't work at all though.
<br>CW Key | I originally ordered something off of Etsy
<br>Headphones or speaker that use a traditional audio jack
<br>Antenna | I bought an EFHW off Etsy. In retrospect I wish I had gotten something easier to deploy. I'm looking at telescoping mast options.

Optional:
<br>Dummy load (optional but highly recommended)
<br>PTT Mic | I haven't picked one up yet but inevitably will. Most are 3d printed on Etsy.

Between assembling the full kit while waiting on my QMX to arrive, I started learning Morse Code with the Morse Mania app. The app alone is insufficient. I plan to also join the Long Island CW Club.

Note that the QMX does not ship with any instructions, so you are left to your own devices to figure out how to actually use it. I have found these two resources helpful:
