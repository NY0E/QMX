# QMX
Notes on the QMX

Buying the QMX from QRP-labs.com is just the first step. It does NOT ship with everything needed to get up and running.

In addition to the radio, the following are also required:
12v power source | I googled "QMX Power source" and found a discussion on QRP-Labs forums with specific amazon listings
CW Key | I originally ordered something off of Etsy
Headphones or speaker that use a traditional audio jack
Antenna | I bought an EFHW off Etsy. In retrospect I wish I had gotten something easier to deploy.

Optional:
Dummy load (optional but highly recommended)
PTT Mic | I haven't picked one up yet but inevitably will. Most are 3d printed on Etsy.

Between assembling the full kit while waiting on my QMX to arrive, I started learning Morse Code with the Morse Mania app. The app alone is insufficient. I plan to also join the Long Island CW Club.
